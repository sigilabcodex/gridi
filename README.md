# GRIDI

**Generative Rhythmic Indeterministic Digital Instrument**

---

**Current version: 0.32.4**

## What is GRIDI?

> GRIDI is a generative rhythmic instrument built around controlled indeterminism, non-musical mathematics, and human interaction.

GRIDi explores the tension between structure and indeterminacy through modular sequencing engines and mathematically-driven sound systems.

### Core Concepts

- Modular voices

- SEQ vs Timbre separation

- Determinism vs Density

- CA / Euclid / Hybrid engines (& more to come)

- Look-ahead scheduling

- WebAudio native timing

---

### Architecture Pillars

- Plug-in module anatomy

- Look-ahead clock

- Envelope discipline

---

### Roadmap (condensed)

- v0.30 — Modular Awakening ✅

- v0.31 — Core Reinforcement (in progress)

- v0.32.4 — SEQ structural separation (current)

- v0.4 — Performance routing

- v0.5 — Generative ecosystem

### Philosophy

This is not a drum machine.  
This is a rhythmic instrument (or toy).

---

### Dedication

**Dedicated to Taniel Morales (1970–2026)**  
Artist, teacher, friend, seeder of ideas and communities.  
Who taught that structure and chaos are not opposites but different ways of listening.
